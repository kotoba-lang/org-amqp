  "AMQP 1.0 Part 2 (Transport) §2.7 Performatives + §2.8.14 Error. Every
  field name/type/order/descriptor code in `amqp.performative` was
  transcribed verbatim from the spec's own `<field>` tables (see that
  namespace's docstring for how); this suite proves round trips and the
  trailing-null-omission wire optimization, and that a wrong/foreign
  descriptor is rejected rather than silently misread."
